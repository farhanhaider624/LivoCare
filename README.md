# LivoCare

## Problem Statement:
Elderly people have been suffering from a lot more health challenges than they did
a few decades ago. Also, the number of elderly living by themselves has been
increasing. They need to have easy access to healthcare services. While there are
apps in the market for healthcare, they donâ€™t cater to specific challenges of elderly.
Frame your assumptions and come up with an app which will help elderly people
find doctors at ease and also find alternative healthcare options such as yoga,
acupuncture at home, etc.
