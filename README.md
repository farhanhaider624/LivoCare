# LivoCare

## Problem Statement:
Elderly people have been suffering from a lot more health challenges than they did
a few decades ago. Also, the number of elderly living by themselves has been
increasing. They need to have easy access to healthcare services. While there are
apps in the market for healthcare, they don’t cater to specific challenges of elderly.
Frame your assumptions and come up with an app which will help elderly people
find doctors at ease and also find alternative healthcare options such as yoga,
acupuncture at home, etc.

## Solution:
Thisi App UI flow is well-aligned with the problem statement, addressing the needs of elderly users who require simplified access to healthcare services. Here’s a description of how each part of the UI addresses the problem:

**Login**: A simple login step ensures that the user has personalized access to their health data, appointments, and family sharing features, enabling ease of access each time they use the app.

**Home**: The "Home" section includes an overview of the user’s Current Status, which likely shows important, high-level health information or updates that the elderly might need at a glance. This provides a quick way to access relevant information without navigating through multiple screens.

**Appointment**: This section allows elderly users to Book Services directly through the app. The options for At Home or At Center appointments address mobility issues, providing flexibility for those who prefer or require care at home. Additionally, the Schedule and One-to-One Doctor options facilitate organized and personalized care, making it easy for the elderly to plan their healthcare visits and consultations without hassle.

**Medication**: This section simplifies access to essential medication management. The Get Prescription feature allows elderly users to access their prescriptions conveniently, and the Buy/Order option offers a straightforward way to purchase medicines online, which is especially useful for users with limited mobility or those living alone.

**Family**: The Family section is designed to enhance support from loved ones. Adding the feature for family members to track the health status, including metrics like blood pressure,  heart rate, and other relevant health indicators makes the app even more supportive for elderly users ensuring family members are informed about their wellbeing. Location Access further supports safety, as family members can monitor the user's location for emergency support if needed.

Each section of your app UI directly addresses specific challenges elderly users face. The design is simplified and intuitive, focusing on ease of access to essential healthcare services, alternative care options, and family support, making it a well-rounded solution for elderly healthcare accessibility.
